### What problem does this paper address?

The authors attempt to build a tool which can verify network control and dataplanes while remaining scalable enough for real, large network deployments.

### What is the authors' main insight?

The authors model the network using constraint based graphs and combinatorial search through this graph for verification of configuration.

### Strengths/Weaknesses?

The model works for a complex protocol such as BGP and can be generalized to other network protocols.

The model explicitly encodes low level details about the network, which may be hard to maintain as networks evolve.

### Any other comments/thoughts?

N/A

### Did you enjoy reading this paper?
