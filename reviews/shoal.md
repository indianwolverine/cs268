### What problem does this paper address?

A power efficient and performant network fabric is required to connect disaggregated blades in a rack.

### Strengths/Weaknesses?

The solution surprisingly achieves even lower power usage than current rack fabrics, which is a cool result by itself. 

How does this scale for datacenter scale disaggregation?

### Any other comments/thoughts?
