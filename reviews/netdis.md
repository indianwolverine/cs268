### What problem does this paper address?

This paper tries to characterize the latency and bandwidth requirements for a network fabric connecting disaggregated blades in a DDC and uses these requirements to determine if they are feasible to meet using existing commodity hardware.

### Strengths/Weaknesses?

This paper develops a nice model for simulating traffic in a disaggreated system, which informs the characterization and further simulation of applications easily.

It would have also been interesting to see how applications can be restructured or better architected for disaggrated hardware and what would be required of the network fabric in such a scheme.

### What impact do you think disaggregation will have on application design and implementation?

I think applications will be designed to scale consume as many resources as possible while not breaking the logical abstraction of disaggregation just as applications now expand to use as many resources as the hardware provides.
