### What do you think will be the biggest problem that the field of networking will face in the coming 10-15 years?

I think one of the biggest problems facing the field of networking in the coming decade is the issue of extending decent internet coverage to the rest of the global population. Unfortunately, it seems that much of networking research today is focused on optimizing the last bit of performance in highly specialized datacenter environments, and not nearly enough work is being done on the frontiers of networking such as the more rural areas of the world, what our space networks will look like etc. While the datacenter work is certainly valuable from a capitalist perspective, it is decidedly uninteresting from the perspective of using the internet as a medium of information dissemination for the enrichment of people everywhere. I think networking, as it stands, is performant enough for most common needs; I just think we should strive to being that functionality to more people. Another key problem that then ties into this is how we can ensure more accurate information on the internet as well as take back control of information/data from corporations and run federated services, which I think is the utopian vision for an internet beneficial to users primarily.

### What is the key research question we can/should tackle to address this problem?

First, we need to figure out how to reliably get internet access to previously ignored communities. In parallel, we will have to build the federated systems which can handle the user load of the current internet and start to socialize users and migrate them to this new medium. The problems here aren't technical alone in nature, and will involve large scale collaboration among experts from a myriad of fields. In addition, in the current capitalist economic ecosystem, there needs to be financial incentive/backing for such a large scale effort to succeed, which is perhaps the biggest problem since not enough people will want to work on such an issue unless there is sufficient funding involved.
