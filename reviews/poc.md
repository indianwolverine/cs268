### What problem does this paper address?

The majority of traffic on the internet is handled by major ISPs through their backbone networks. A change in this infrastructure is needed which can enforce network neutrality and foster competition in this space.

### What is the authors' main insight?

The authors propose a nonprofit run public backbone network for the internet which includes peers that all interconnect with one another. 

### Strengths/Weaknesses

The vision for the PoC seems pretty clear, even if there are a lot of details which need to be sorted out.

What motivation do ISPs have to let a PoC carve out a piece from their traditional territory. It seems that there might be significant resistance from dominant ISPs on this front.
