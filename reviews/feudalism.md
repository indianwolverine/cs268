### What problem does this paper address?

This paper explores feudalism on the internet (power disproportionately held by a few providers) and tries to understand why approaches to democratizing the internet have failed as well as what problems must be solved to acheive a democratic internet. 

### What is the authors' main insight?

A number of key properties motivate centralization on the internet such as convenience, homogeniety, cost, performance, security, and financing. It's very difficult for decentralized services to provide these same properties, which makes them not as attractive to users. A number of decentralized services in domains such as naming, group communication, data storage, and web apps have been developed, but struggle with social problems on the platforms as well as infrastructure problems which large providers are able to address with massive software cadres.

### Strengths/Weaknesses?

This paper correctly addresses why decentralized systems have failed to take off and proposes a number of problems which must be addressed in order to see a democratic internet come to fruition.

There is emphasis placed on blockchain as a promising building block for decentralized systems, but it's not obvious that this is the right move. There is no reason the internet should in fact be democratic, and its not even clear what democracy on the internet even means. There is reason to believe that feudalism on the internet is not in the best interest of users, but seeing change here will likely require economic policy in addition to technical innovation.
