### What problem does this paper address?

This paper addresses the problem of building and maintaining frontier networks, specifically highlighting the challenges in planning frontier networks and proposing a solution to this problem.

### What is the authors' main insight?

The authors first outline a number of difficulties involved in planning and implementing frontier networks, namely the lack of technical expertise by frontier network operators, a myriad of bureaucratic issues when dealing with local regulations. In short, there are both technical and social issues to deal with, and there currently exists no solution to automate any of this process.

The authors additionally propose a system to automate frontier network planning which incorporates the contraints encountered in a real system to allow lone operators to more easily plan and deploy their frontier network.

### Strengths/Weaknesses?

This paper addresses the challenges inherent in deploying frontier networks well. 

What about the technical expertise required to even use the proposed automated planning application? Moreover, if the automated planner cannot in fac take into account all of the factors that may pop up in a real environment, it will be next to useless. Often, there are situations too complex to represent in a planner as well - the main problem being that the automated nature of the planning application is not congruent with the more fluid nature of human affairs.
