### What problem does this paper address?

Private networks such as those owned by cloud providers increasingly provide an array of services which are not ostensibly in line with the service model of the internet. These services are however desired by users and it would be useful to have them in the public internet as well.

### What is the authors' main insight?

The authors propose an extensible internet (EI) architecture in which a service layer (layer 3.5) is added to the internet. A set of service nodes similar to POPs deployed by cloud providers is also needed for EI. The service nodes then provide the service abstraction for end hosts. In this architecture, services can incrementally by deployed on public service nodes in the form of open source software, and provide beenfits that cloud services provide, but on the public internet as well.

### Strengths/Weaknesses?

This is a very cool idea and it will be interesting to see how traditional ISPs react to this as it gains more widespread adoption. 

I'm not sure I can see any obvious weaknesses outright.
