### What problem does this paper address?

This paper describes the development and deployment of B4, a private WAN connecting Google's datacenters.

### What is the authors' main insight?

The authors opt for an SDN + OpenFlow architecture for B4 where switches expose an OpenFlow interface to centralized controllers for prgrammability. This keeps the hardware simple, and through the centralization of the controller logic, allows for novel applications to be built on top such as custom traffic engineering which allows B4 links to reach nearly full utilization, cutting down on infrastructure costs.

### Strengths/Weaknesses?

In addition to being a real deployment of SDN ideas at scale, perhaps the best thing about industry papers such as this is the insight from actually running and maintaining such a system, especially during failure, or traffic spikes, unexpected, but planned for events in general.

From an intellectual perspective, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of novel work here so much as a synthesis of well researched ideas. However, this isn't really a problem since actually running a service like this involves so much more complexity than is often addressed in the typical research context that it is valuable to see the lessons from deployment.
