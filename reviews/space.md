### What problem does this paper address?

How should we design a lower earth orbit satellite based network to achieve low latency and broad connectivity globally (specifically looking at the Starlink specs).

### Strengths/Weaknesses?

This paper takes a good first stab at conceptualizing how Starlink might look when deployed and forms a basic idea of how routing should be done on such a network (Djikstra's) and how connectivity should be provided. 

The main weakness here is that this paper is looking at a specific instantiation of a LEO satellite network and optimizing some properties of the design. A more interesting question is - is this network mesh even the right design to begin with? Can we get away with fewer satellites? How do different satellite configurations fundamentally differ from the one presented here?

### Any other comments/thoughts?

What about interplanetary networks - how would we design these?
