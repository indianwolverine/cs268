\begin{abstract}
    Active networking is a networking paradigm in which "active" switches execute instructions encoded in incoming packets as opposed to simply enacting static protocols. This ability to dynamically execute a rich set of instructions for different incoming packets enables a host of opportunities for the network, such as better network introspection and monitoring, network debugging, and novel traffic engineering. The active networking vision previously failed due to the lack of a killer app and the difficulties inherent in deployment. However, with the advent of programmable switches, we envision a new age for active networking. In this paper, we develop a network instruction set architecture (NISA) to demonstrate the utility of active networks and provide a set of primitives to program them \cite{nisa}. Additionally, we show how easy NISA is to use by building a simple network monitoring and debuggability tool on top of it.
